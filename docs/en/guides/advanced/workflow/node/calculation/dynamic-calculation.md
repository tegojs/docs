# Dynamic Expression Calculation Node

## Create Node

Create a dynamic expression calculation node:

<!-- ![Create Dynamic Expression Calculation Node] -->
<!-- TODO: Insert image -->

## Node Configuration

### Dynamic Expression

Different from the expression option of ordinary calculation nodes, dynamic expressions need to be selected based on data that has already been queried, rather than directly entering expressions. Select the product discount rule data preloaded from the trigger:

<!-- ![Select Dynamic Expression Data] -->
<!-- TODO: Insert image -->

### Variable Data Source

You also need to select the data table data row object that variables in the expression need to use, which can be selected from the process context as results that have been loaded (or queried) in advance. This object needs to be a data row object of the data table associated in the expression data. Here, select product data:

<!-- ![Select Variable Data Source] -->
<!-- TODO: Insert image -->

Save the node configuration to complete all configuration processes.
