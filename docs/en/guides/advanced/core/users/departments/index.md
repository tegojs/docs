# Departments

## Introduction

The Departments plugin supports organizing users in TachyBase in the form of departments, establishing hierarchical relationships. You can control the permissions of a group of users by binding roles to departments. Department information can be used as variables in workflows, expressions, and other places that support variable settings.
