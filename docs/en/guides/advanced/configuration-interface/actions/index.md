# Actions

In the UI, actions are buttons used to trigger a set of instructions. They can be placed directly on pages, dialogs, or drawers, and can also be used in combination with blocks. Currently, dynamically configurable actions are mainly used in combination with blocks.

## Action Designer (Toolbar)

Unlike blocks and fields, the action designer only has two icons:
- Drag and drop
- Parameter configuration

Hold the "Drag and drop" icon in the button designer to sort buttons.
