# Operation Configuration

Depending on the context type configured in the workflow, the operation button configuration in different blocks also differs.

## No Context

> v.1.6.0+

In action panels and other data blocks, "Trigger Workflow" buttons can be added:

After adding the button, bind the previously created context-free workflow. Taking the button in the action panel as an example:

![Select workflow to bind_No context](/actions/trigger-workflow-2.png)

## Single Row Record

In any data block, "Trigger Workflow" buttons can be added to the operation bar for single row data, such as forms, table data rows, details, etc.:

![Block add operation button_Form](/actions/trigger-workflow-11.png)

![Block add operation button_Table row](/actions/trigger-workflow-12.png)

![Block add operation button_Details](/actions/trigger-workflow-13.png)

After adding the button, bind the previously created workflow:

![Button bind workflow](/actions/trigger-workflow-21.png)

![Select workflow to bind](/actions/trigger-workflow-22.png)

After that, clicking this button will trigger this custom operation event:
