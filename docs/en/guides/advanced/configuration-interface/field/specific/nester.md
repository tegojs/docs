# Sub-form

### Overview

Sub-form is suitable for scenarios where relationship data is created first and then associated. Multi-level relationship data is clearly displayed through nested form format. Unlike data picker and dropdown selector, sub-form can directly maintain relationship table fields in blocks on the current page, and relationship data is submitted together with the main table.
