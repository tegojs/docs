# Required

## Introduction

Required is a common rule for form validation. You can directly enable required in field configuration items, or dynamically set fields as required through form linkage rules.

## Static Setting

Directly set field as required, suitable for fields that always need to be filled by users, such as username, password, etc.

## Dynamic Setting (Conditional Required)

Set required conditionally through linkage rules of form blocks.

Example: When order status is shipped, shipping date field is required.
