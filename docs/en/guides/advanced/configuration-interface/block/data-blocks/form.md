# Form

## Introduction

The form block is an important block for building data input and editing interfaces. It is highly customizable and uses corresponding components to display required fields based on the data model. Through linkage rules, form blocks can dynamically display fields. In addition, it can be combined with workflows to achieve automated process triggering and data processing, further improving work efficiency or implementing logic orchestration.
