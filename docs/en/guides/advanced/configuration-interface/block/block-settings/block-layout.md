# Layout

## Introduction

Form-type blocks such as form blocks, details blocks, and list blocks support layout settings. Layout methods are divided into vertical layout (labels and input boxes arranged row by row) and horizontal layout (labels and input boxes placed side by side). This flexible layout choice can optimize user experience according to specific needs, ensuring information input is both clear and efficient.


### Vertical (Default)

Sub-forms and sub-forms (popover) also support layout configuration, with vertical layout as default.


### Horizontal

Horizontal layout places labels and input boxes side by side, saving space.
