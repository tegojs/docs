# Block Templates

## Introduction

Save a data type block as a template. When adding blocks in the future, you can directly copy or reference this template. For example, if a form for a data table is used both for adding data and editing data, then this form can be saved as a template and referenced in the interfaces for adding and editing data.

## How to Add and Use Templates?

1. When adding blocks, select to copy or reference the template.


## Difference Between Copy and Reference

Copy creates a brand new block based on the block template. Block adjustments do not affect the module. Reference directly uses the block template. Block adjustments will change the template, and all blocks that reference the current template will change.

## Notes

- Templates created using relationship blocks can only be used to create relationship blocks.
- Templates created using non-relationship blocks can only be used to create non-relationship blocks.
